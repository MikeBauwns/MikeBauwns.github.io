## What is the challenge challenge?

The Reply Cybersecurity challenge took place on October 14-15, 2022, and happens every year. It's a contest where teams of up to four people can compete. The competition has challenges in five different categories: Coding, Web, Binary, Crypto, and Miscellaneous. In the Miscellaneous category, participants face special challenges that involve elements from different categories.


## How did it go?

Three of us joined the challenge even though we didn't have much experience in CTFs. But we were excited about the opportunity and gave it our all. The challenges were tough but taught us a lot. They required us to think hard and come up with creative solutions instead of the obvious ones.

## How did it end?

While our final ranking wasn't exceptionally high, we managed to secure the 204th place. Participating in the challenge provided us with valuable learning opportunities, introducing us to new skills and fostering a fresh mindset towards problem-solving. Above all, the experience was immensely enjoyable, and I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone with an interest in cybersecurity.
