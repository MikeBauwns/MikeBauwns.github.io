## What is the challenge challenge?

The Reply Code Challenge took place on March 9, 2023, and happens every year. The challenge consisted of six different coding challenges that you had to solve/create. You earned points for completing challenges, the difficulty of the challenge, accuracy, how fast you solved them, and in exceptional cases, there are bonus points.


## How did it go?

I joined this challenge with a friend. We both study cybersecurity, so this challenge was a bit more difficult for us than the cybersecurity challenge. After a long day of programming, we didn't earn many points, so we ended up towards the bottom in the 2433rd place.

## How did it end?


After the challenge officially ended, I continued working on some remaining challenges. Without the time limit, the stress decreased, and the process became somewhat smoother. However, even if I found the solutions earlier, the outcome wouldn't change much.
