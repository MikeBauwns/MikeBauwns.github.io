## What is Github Galaxy?

GitHub Galaxy was a four-day conference organized by GitHub, taking place from March 28 to March 31. The conference covered a broad range of subjects, such as software development cycles, AI, security, and productivity. It had many speakers from different fields, including GitHub staff and experienced developers in the technology industry.


## How did it go?

I had a really interesting time attending GitHub Galaxy. It gave me a lot of valuable information about how tech companies work, especially for managers in big organizations. Even if you're not a manager, it can still be helpful if your company uses GitHub. The conference focused on showing the newest features and tools in GitHub, with a special emphasis on how they can make teams more productive and help manage them effectively. Going to GitHub Galaxy was a great way to stay updated on the latest things happening in the GitHub world.


## How did it end?

The GitHub Galaxy conference spanned four days and had many informative sessions. It started with an interesting presentation on GitHub Co-Pilot and enterprise features. The second day had two sessions about software development, sharing tips on writing better code more easily. The third day focused on security practices in development. Finally, on the fourth day, there were two sessions on collaboration, highlighting how enterprise tools can help developers work better and get started smoothly.

## In conclusion
The GitHub Galaxy conference was a very interesting event that showcased how things can and perhaps should be done in the workplace. I would recommend it to anyone who uses tools from GitHub.
